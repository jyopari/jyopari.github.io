# Gamma Distribution
The [gamma distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_distribution) is a distribution over the time it takes for the `a'th` poisson event parametrized by `Î»` to occur. Its similar to the [exponential distribution](https://jyopari.github.io/exponentialDist), and I will be using the same technique I used to derive the exponential distribution to derive the gamma distribution.

This is the discrete distribution, where we find the total possible ways for `a-1` events can be arranges in the `n` pieces of time. The reason its `a-1` and not `a` is because the last event has to happen at time `t`.  

# Continous Distribution
Similar to what we did for the exponential distribution, diving the discrete distribution by the size of each time interval will give us the probability density function (PDF). Below are the steps of how to arrive to the gamma distribution.
