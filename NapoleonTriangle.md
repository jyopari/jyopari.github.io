# Napoleon's Theorem
I came across the [napoleon's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon%27s_theorem#:~:text=In%20geometry%2C%20Napoleon%27s%20theorem%20states,themselves%20form%20an%20equilateral%20triangle.&text=The%20theorem%20is%20often%20attributed,Bonaparte%20(1769–1821).) when I stumbled across my CS Professer's [Puzzle Corner](https://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/tr/). Here is the problem description from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon%27s_theorem#:~:text=In%20geometry%2C%20Napoleon%27s%20theorem%20states,themselves%20form%20an%20equilateral%20triangle.&text=The%20theorem%20is%20often%20attributed,Bonaparte%20(1769–1821).).
`Napoleon's theorem states that if equilateral triangles are constructed on the sides of any triangle, either all outward or all inward, the lines connecting the centres of those equilateral triangles themselves form an equilateral triangle.`

## Verification
To finally show that the distances are the same, I was not brave enough to simplify that expression. 
Instead, I plugged it into an online simplifer.
