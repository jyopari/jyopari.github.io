## Diffusion Models

Thank you to [Alfredo Canziani](https://atcold.github.io/) for giving me the opportunity to teach his and [Yann LeCun's](https://research.facebook.com/people/lecun-yann/) Deep Learning Class for Fall 2022!
To teach the students about the implementation side of Diffusion Models, I coded up a notebook that learns to model a simple 2D distribution. Here we can see the sampling process in action. <br >

Here is the full [Notebook](https://github.com/jyopari/jyopari.github.io/blob/master/diffusion/Toy_Diffusion_Notebook_DL_Class.ipynb) that I wrote. Thank you to [Mark Goldstein](https://marikgoldstein.github.io/) for reviewing this notebook and providing me with deeper insights on this topic.
