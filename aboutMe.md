## Hello!

I am Jyothish Pari, Jyo for short, an undergraduate student studying CS and Math at NYU. In my free time I like playing with my two parakeets, catching (and releasing) insects, folding origami, and racing (virtually). Currently a research assistant at [CILVR NYU](https://wp.nyu.edu/cilvr/) advised by [Dr. Pinto](https://lerrelpinto.com).
