## Hello!
I am Jyothish Pari, Jyo for short, an undergraduate student studying CS and Math at NYU. In my free time I like playing with my two parakeets, catching (and releasing) insects, folding origami, and racing (virtually). Currently advised by [Dr.Pinto](https://lerrelpinto.com), working on a research project to improve imitation learning.
