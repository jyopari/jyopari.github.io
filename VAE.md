# Variational Autoencoders
## Introduction
Variational autoencoders  merges deep learning and probability in a very intrugring manner. If you have heard of autoencoders, variational autoencoders are similar but are much better for generating data. There are many resources that explain why vanialla autoencoders aren't good generative models, but the gist is the latent space is not compact, and there are lots of dead space that produces jargon.

Variational Inference
Variational autoencoder takes pillar ideas from variational inference. I will exlain what these pillars are. First there is something called ELBO. Let me plop down an derivation, it is ubigquitous, so you proabbly would have seen this. 

The steps
