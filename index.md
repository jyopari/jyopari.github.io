## I try to include an implementation for each applicable topic, enjoy!

## Machine Learning
+ Transformers + Their applications (BERT / GPT, Image GPT)

## Statistics
+ MCMC
  - [Metropolis Hastings](https://jyopari.github.io/MetropolisHastings)
  - Gibbs Sampling
+ [Gaussian Process](https://jyopari.github.io/GaussianProcess)

## Both Machine Learning and Statistics
+ Variational Autoencoders (VAE)

## Reinforcement Learning
+ [QLearning](https://jyopari.github.io/QLearning)
+ DQN
+ PPO 

## Misc
+ Monte Carlo Tree Search
+ [How Similar is _____ to _____?](https://jyopari.github.io/Similarity)
